# Database-Normalization
This was the final group project for Database Course at Queens College with Professor Peter Heller.

## Project Phases and Goals 
### PHASE ONE : Data Inspection
Change table and column names according to Pascal Form
Adjust data types with appropriate max lengths
Remove or fix anomalies in table data
### PHASE TWO : ERD Model Development
Relate all tables using primary surrogate keys
Use non-clustered unique index to create functional dependency on surrogate key
Normalize database model in 3NF
Create production tables to transform FileUpload tables to normalized tables
### PHASE THREE : Stored Procedures
Create stored Procedures to load the production model

## Finally
After using the first 3 normal forms of normalization, we were able to come up with new tables that minimize data redundancies.
